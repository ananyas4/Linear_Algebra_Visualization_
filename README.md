#  Linear Algebra Visualization  
 **Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's Linear Algebra Playlist**  
 **Educational Tool for Students and Professionals**

This project is a **visualization tool for 3D linear transformations**, designed to make **linear algebra concepts more accessible and engaging**. Inspired by the visual storytelling in **3Blue1Brown's Essence of Linear Algebra series**, this tool aims to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical ideas and real-world understanding.

## 🔍 Purpose
- To educate **students** and **professionals** by visualizing **3D linear transformations** such as:
  - Scaling
  - Rotation
  - Shearing
  - Reflection
- To act as a **gateway to deeper topics** like:
  - Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
  - Span and basis
  - Matrix multiplication and determinants.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time 3D visualizations** of matrices acting on vectors and objects in space.
- **Interactive exploration** of transformations with sliders and input fields for matrix values.
- **Dynamic explanations** to demonstrate concepts like:
  - How eigenvectors remain invariant under transformations.
  - How span changes with linear combinations.
- **Educational prompts** that guide users to understand key insights.

##  Inspiration
This project was inspired by **3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra" playlist**, which uses elegant visualizations to explain the foundations of linear algebra. The goal of this project is to **extend these concepts into an interactive 3D environment**.
